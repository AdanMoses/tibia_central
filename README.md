# TIBIA CENTRAL

A social media focused on the MMO videogame, Tibia, where users can post/share screenshots and/or text, and they can interact with each other's posts.

## Features I'm working on

- For users to be able to register to the website and link their Tibia character to their account. -- Done
- For users to automatically make a post when their character dies/levels up.
- For users to be able to edit the posts later on to be able to add an image of their deaths/achievemnts.
- For users to be able to ad posts with text and/or images. -- Only text so far.
- For users to be able to interact with each other's posts.
