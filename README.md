# TIBIA CENTRAL

A social media focused on the MMO videogame, Tibia, where users can post/share screenshots and/or text, and they can interact with each other's posts.

## Features I'm working on

- For users to be able to register to the website and link their Tibia character to their account. -- Done
- For users to automatically make a post when their character dies/levels up.
- For users to be able to edit the posts later on to be able to add an image of their deaths/achievemnts.
- For users to be able to ad posts with text and/or images. -- Only text so far.
- For users to be able to interact with each other's posts.

## TODO
There's quite a bit of work to be done to this project, there's a lot that has to be rewriten, due to work and personal commitments I've fallen behind but will continue to work on it over the next several weeks.

- Anyone can delete a file, this should be fixed to only user who posted
- There's still a bit of work to do with sessions and who can see what
- Need to add posts interaction
- Need to work on the design, I am hopeless
- Need to rethink UI and UX, will get functionality done and then try to refactor as I learn more about more techonologies and best practices
